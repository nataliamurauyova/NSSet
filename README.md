# NSSet
Please, find your tasks on NSSet and NSMutableSet bellow:
Create NSArray, containing 30 objects. Add duplicates to array.
- Use NSSet to exclude duplicates from array.
- Check what is faster:
    Create an array of 100 numbers. Check whether number 74 is contained inside an array.
    Transform array into NSSet and check whether number 74 is contained inside NSSet.
